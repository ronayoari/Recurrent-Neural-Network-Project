## Stage 1: TOKENIZE TEXT  
We have raw text, but we want to make predictions on a per-word basis.  
This means we must tokenize our comments into sentences, and sentences into words.   
At first, we want to choose the dictionary that we'll work with him.  
We choose the collection of the most common words in the text.  
Tokens:
